# Welcome to ExportECON!
(ECON being short for economy)

This is a simple app that is meant to give people a small, but educational nonetheless, understanding of world economics and trade
Its purpose is to show users the item makeup of exports and imports of most countries in the world, and also to be able to 
show data on basic economic measurements for these countries, such as GDP, GDP per capita, etc.

This app was made with help from API's like Axios, Cheerio, and HighCharts. In addition, the data used in this application was taken from Wikipedia and also from Harvard University's Atlas of Economic Complexity.
